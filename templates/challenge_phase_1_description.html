<h2>Development Phase</h2>

<p>The Development Phase of the DRL for Real competition is designed to allow participants to develop and refine their disentangled representation learning methods using the provided training datasets. This phase focuses on model development, experimentation, and validation.</p>

<p>This phase runs from January 15, 2025 to August 15, 2025, providing participants with seven months to develop robust disentangled representation learning methods.</p>

<h3>Development Phase Details:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Available Resources:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Training datasets containing real-world data with various factors of variation</li>
      <li>Validation datasets for preliminary evaluation</li>
      <li>Baseline implementations of common disentanglement methods</li>
      <li>Evaluation code implementing the competition metrics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Participant Activities:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop models that learn disentangled representations of the data factors</li>
      <li>Experiment with different architectures, loss functions, and training strategies</li>
      <li>Evaluate models on the validation set using the provided evaluation metrics</li>
      <li>Receive feedback on model performance in terms of disentanglement, robustness, interpretability, and practical utility</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation Criteria:</strong> Same as the Test Phase
    <ul>
      <li><em>Disentanglement (25%):</em> How well the model separates different factors of variation</li>
      <li><em>Robustness (25%):</em> How well the representations maintain their properties under perturbations</li>
      <li><em>Interpretability (20%):</em> How easily humans can understand the learned representations</li>
      <li><em>Practical Utility (30%):</em> How useful the representations are for downstream tasks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The leaderboard for this phase will not be public, allowing participants to experiment with different approaches without revealing their performance to other competitors. This encourages exploration and innovation without the pressure of public rankings.</p>

<h3>Submission Guidelines:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Participants can make up to 5 submissions per day</li>
  <li>Maximum of 50 submissions in total during this phase</li>
  <li>Each submission should include model code and any necessary weights</li>
  <li>A brief description of the approach is encouraged but not required</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage participants to focus on developing methods that not only achieve high disentanglement scores but also demonstrate practical utility in real-world applications. The most successful approaches will balance theoretical disentanglement properties with practical considerations such as computational efficiency and downstream task performance.</p>
