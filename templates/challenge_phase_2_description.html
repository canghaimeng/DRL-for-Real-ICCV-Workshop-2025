<h2>Test Phase</h2>

<p>The Test Phase of the DRL for Real competition is the final evaluation stage where participants' models are tested on unseen real-world data to assess their generalization capabilities and practical utility in real-world applications.</p>

<p>This phase runs from August 16, 2025 to October 15, 2025, giving participants two months to finalize and submit their best models.</p>

<h3>Test Phase Details:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Submission Requirements:</strong> Participants will submit their final models trained on the development datasets. Submissions must include:
    <ul>
      <li>Model code with clear instructions for execution</li>
      <li>A detailed technical report (max 4 pages) describing the approach</li>
      <li>Pre-trained model weights (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation Process:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Models will be evaluated on a hidden test set containing new, unseen real-world data with diverse factors of variation</li>
      <li>The test set includes challenging scenarios such as domain shifts, noisy inputs, and partial observations</li>
      <li>Performance will be measured across all four key metrics: disentanglement, robustness, interpretability, and practical utility</li>
      <li>Results will be displayed on a public leaderboard, allowing participants to compare their approaches with others</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation Criteria:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Disentanglement (25%):</em> How well the model separates different factors of variation</li>
      <li><em>Robustness (25%):</em> How well the representations maintain their properties under perturbations</li>
      <li><em>Interpretability (20%):</em> How easily humans can understand the learned representations</li>
      <li><em>Practical Utility (30%):</em> How useful the representations are for downstream tasks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The test phase emphasizes the real-world applicability of disentangled representations. Models that perform well on synthetic datasets but fail to generalize to real-world scenarios will be penalized. Conversely, models that demonstrate strong practical utility in real-world applications will be rewarded.</p>

<p>The final ranking will be determined based on the weighted sum of all metrics, with a particular emphasis on practical utility and robustness in real-world settings.</p>

<h3>Submission Guidelines:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Participants can make up to 5 submissions per day</li>
  <li>Maximum of 50 submissions in total during this phase</li>
  <li>We encourage participants to select their best model from the development phase for final evaluation</li>
  <li>Top-performing teams will be invited to present their work at the DRL for Real ICCV 2025 Workshop</li>
</ul>

<p>The winners will be announced at the DRL for Real Workshop at ICCV 2025, where top teams will have the opportunity to present their approaches and discuss future directions for disentangled representation learning in real-world applications.</p>
