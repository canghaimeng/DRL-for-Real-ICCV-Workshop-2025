<h2>Submission Guidelines for DRL for Real Competition</h2>

<p>This competition focuses on developing and evaluating disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods on realistic datasets. Participants are expected to submit their models and results following these guidelines:</p>

<h3>Submission Requirements</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Model Submission</strong>: Submit your trained model along with the code used for training and evaluation. The model should be capable of learning disentangled representations from the provided datasets.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Include a detailed description of your approach, highlighting the key innovations and how your method addresses the challenges of applying DRL to real-world data.</li>
  <li><strong>Results</strong>: Provide quantitative results on the evaluation metrics (Disentanglement, Robustness, Interpretability, and Practical Utility).</li>
  <li><strong>Visualization</strong>: Include visualizations that demonstrate the disentangled nature of your learned representations.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>

<p>Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Disentanglement</strong>: How well does your model separate different factors of variation in the data?</li>
  <li><strong>Robustness</strong>: How well does your model perform under different real-world conditions and perturbations?</li>
  <li><strong>Interpretability</strong>: How easily can humans understand the learned representations?</li>
  <li><strong>Practical Utility</strong>: How useful are the disentangled representations for downstream tasks?</li>
</ul>

<p>The final ranking will be determined by the weighted sum of these metrics, with an emphasis on practical utility and real-world applicability.</p>

<h3>Submission Format</h3>

<p>Please submit your files in one of the following formats: .zip, .tar.gz, or through a GitHub repository link. Ensure that your submission includes all necessary code, models, and documentation as specified above.</p>
